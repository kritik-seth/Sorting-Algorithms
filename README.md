# Sorting
Different types of Sorting Algorithms and their comparison
This repository contains the following sorting algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Shell Sort *
5. Merge Sort (Top-Down) Approach
6. Quick Sort
7. Shell Sort
8. Heap Sortt

### * Shell Sort is Implemented using the following formulas
1. Using Knuth's Formula
2. Using Hibbard's Formula
3. Using Tokuda's Formula
4. Using Divide by 2 rule


## Guidelines for contributing
1. If not present, create a folder with the algorithm name.
2. Add your Algorithm and its solution to the respective folder named as [Algorithm_Name- Language]
3. If text is already present, do not add again, make any necessary changes if needed.
4. If any new algorithm is added, please make the necessary changes too the Algorithms file also.
